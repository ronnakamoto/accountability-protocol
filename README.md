## Accountability Protocol

Accountability Protocol is a novel milestone based decentralized protocol that can bring accountability to the world of Crypto Fund raising, where a lot of projects have been rug-pulling investors by not even caring to build the roadmap promised.

Accountability Protocol brings accountability to this existing corrupted system.

## Why not use popular Fund Raising dApps?

The issue is at the core of all existing platforms. Because the goal of all platforms is to generate revenue. For this, it is in their best interest to not bring accountability to the fund raises. Or maybe they might never have thought about it in the first place ðŸ˜„.

## How Does Accountability Protocol Work?

The Accountability Protocol works by breaking down a project that seeks funds into milestones that require Proof-Of-Milestone(PoM).

Proof-Of-Milestone is the proof that represent what the expectations of the miletone was and what have been met. It is presented as a URI.

Once a project submits the Proof-Of-Milestone, investors can start to vote on the milestone approval. Based on the type of Quorum, the amount associated with the milestone is automatically unlocked.

The project can now claim the unlocked amount.

In case of delays, the projects can incentivise the investors via off-chain means. This aligns well with game theory wherein all participants have a favourable outcome.
